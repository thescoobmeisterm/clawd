# 2026-02-04 - Apollo Week 1 Video Production

## Completed
- Fixed video playback freezing issue by re-encoding scenes with proper timestamps (not `-c copy`)
- Created final smooth version: `apollo-week1-final-v2.mp4` (~6.7MB, ~45 sec)
- Generated SRT subtitles for all 7 scenes: `week1-subtitles.srt`

## Scene Breakdown
| Scene | Narration Summary | Emotion |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | Welcome to Apollo's Learning Corner | Excited |
| 2 | SO excited to blast off! | Excited |
| 3 | Ship wobbles, heart goes fast | Scared |
| 4 | Breathing exercise (1-2-3-4-5) | Calm |
| 5 | Ask for help! | Brave |
| 6 | Mission Control helps, lands safely | Happy/Proud |
| 7 | What emotion do YOU feel? | Reflective |

## Next Steps (Pending)
- Add royalty-free background music (kid-friendly, space-themed)
- Create emotion indicators (hearts, text overlays)
- Burn in subtitles or soft-subtitle burn
- Optional: Add intro/outro branding for Apollo's Learning Corner

## Technical Notes
- ffmpeg concat with `-c copy` breaks playback → always re-encode with `-c:v libx264`
- SRT format: index → timestamp range → text
- Total runtime: ~57 seconds

## Resources Identified
- **Music**: Chosic.com/children (free), Bensound.com, YouTube Audio Library
- **Subtitles**: `pm/outputs/apollo/week1-space-emotions/week1-subtitles.srt`
