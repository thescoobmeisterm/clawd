> Assumption for draft: preschool/early K (ages 3–6), theme = “Space + Shapes/Colors + Kindness.”
> If the theme changes, reuse the structure and swap examples.

## 1) Children’s Book Outline (10–12 pages)
**Working Title:** *Apollo’s Shape Rocket*  
**Core Goal:** teach shapes + colors with a gentle “help a friend” story.

**Page 1 — Cover**
- Apollo the astronaut kid waves in front of a simple rocket and stars.

**Page 2 — Setup**
- Text: “Apollo wants to fly today, but his rocket is missing its shape panels!”
- Visual: Rocket with blank panel slots.

**Page 3 — Circle (Red)**
- Apollo meets a red planet. “Can we borrow your red circle?”

**Page 4 — Square (Blue)**
- A floating blue space crate becomes the blue square panel.

**Page 5 — Triangle (Yellow)**
- A yellow star gives a triangle panel.

**Page 6 — Rectangle (Green)**
- A green space banner provides the rectangle panel.

**Page 7 — Heart (Pink)**
- A friendly alien shares a pink heart panel “because friends help friends.”

**Page 8 — Rocket Build**
- Apollo attaches the panels in order (shape + color recap).

**Page 9 — Launch**
- Rocket lights up. “Red circle, blue square, yellow triangle, green rectangle, pink heart!”

**Page 10 — Celebration**
- Apollo thanks each friend. “You helped me fly!”

**Page 11 — Reader Callout**
- “Can you spot the shapes around you?”

**Page 12 — End Page**
- Simple recap grid of shapes + colors.

**Optional Extensions (if 12 pages feels tight):**
- Add a “countdown” page or a “night sky map” activity page.

## 2) Three Short Video Ideas (Titles + Objectives)
1) **“Shape Rocket Build!”**
   - Objective: teach 4 shapes + 4 colors with a quick build sequence and repeatable chant.

2) **“Find the Shape on the Space Station”**
   - Objective: a quick “I-spy” of shapes in a single scene to reinforce recognition.

3) **“Apollo Helps a Friend”**
   - Objective: social-emotional learning (kindness/helping) + shape naming in context.

## 3) Five Printable Ideas
1) **Shape Rocket Assembly** — cut/paste shapes to build a rocket.
2) **Color-by-Shape** — each shape has a color key.
3) **Space I-Spy Shapes** — find and count shapes in a space scene.
4) **Match the Shape** — connect shape cards to matching objects.
5) **Shape Trace Pack** — large outline shapes for tracing practice.

## Notes
- This set aligns with MVP: 1 book + 3 videos + 5 printables.
- Swap theme (e.g., “Ocean,” “Dinosaur,” “Neighborhood”) by replacing visuals/props while keeping the same structure.
