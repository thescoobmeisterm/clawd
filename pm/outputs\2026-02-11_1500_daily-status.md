## 💡 Productivity Insight

**For the rest of the day:**

> **"Ship small, iterate fast."**

You have two launch-ready projects (Apollo + Daydream Tees) sitting at ~95% completion. The last 5% is approval, not work.

**Suggested action:** Pick ONE:
1. **Apollo:** Review + hit publish on 1 video
2. **Daydream Tees:** Manual upload to Etsy (5 min task)

*One small launch beats three perfect plans that never ship.*
