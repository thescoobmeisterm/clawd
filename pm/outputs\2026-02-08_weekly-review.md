## ❌ What Didn't Get Done

| Task | Owner | Status | Why |
|------|-------|--------|-----|
| Decide top 3 automations to pilot | Matt | Todo | Decision pending from list |
| Select primary monetization focus (Pluto) | Matt | Todo | Still evaluating options |
| Define MVP theme + age range (Apollo) | Matt | Todo | Blocked on creative decision |
| Add email capture CTA to Apollo site | Matt | Todo | Needs site access |
| Draft Pluto compliance policies | Clawd | Blocked | Awaiting Matt's compliance Q&A answers |
| Apollo site audit (needs access) | Clawd | Blocked | No site credentials |

**Pattern:** Matt-owned creative/decisions are pending. Clawd outputs are largely complete; waiting on Matt inputs.

## 🔥 Top 5 Priorities for Next Week

| # | Priority | Owner | Next Action |
|---|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Draft Pluto compliance policies** | Clawd | Write rental agreement, insurance, privacy policy based on T-0252 Q&A |
| 2 | **Execute first 5 Daydream Tees listings** | Matt | Upload 3 approved designs to Printify + list on Etsy |
| 3 | **Produce Apollo videos** | Matt | Record Count to 10 video using approved scripts (T-0250) |
| 4 | **Apollo MVP theme selection** | Matt | Choose Math + Shapes + SEL for ages 4-8 |
| 5 | **Pluto monetization focus** | Matt | Pick primary revenue model (rental fees / subscriptions / membership) |

## 📊 Weekly Metrics

| Metric | Count |

| Matt decisions completed | 6 |
| Matt decisions pending | 4 |
| Projects in active status | 4 |
| Projects in idea/todo status | 12 |

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Clawd velocity is high** — outputs are being produced faster than Matt can review/approve. Need faster decision turnaround.

2. **Apollo is closest to launch** — all planning docs are ready; only video production and theme finalization remain.

3. **Daydream Tees is ready to ship** — 3 designs approved, storefront selected. First listings should go live this week.

4. **Pluto needs Matt's attention** — compliance and monetization are blocking progress. Without decisions, can't execute.

5. **NullPointer identity is solidified** — "Free Your Mind" directive integrated; dashboard + convictions complete.
