## 💡 Productivity Tip for the Afternoon

**Batch your decisions:** Instead of context-switching between Apollo content, Daydream Tees designs, and Pluto operations — pick ONE focus block (90 min) and clear decisions for that area before moving on. Your brain does better with focused decision sprints than scattered micro-decisions.
