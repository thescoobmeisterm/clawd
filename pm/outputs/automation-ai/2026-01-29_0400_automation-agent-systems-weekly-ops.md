# Automation & Agent Systems — Weekly Ops System (v1)

## Goal
A repeatable weekly operating system that keeps automation/agent work aligned to revenue impact, with clear intake, prioritization, execution, and reporting.

---

## Weekly Rhythm (60–90 min total)
**Mon — Capture + Triage (20–30 min)**
- Pull new ideas/tasks from: inbox, notes, support issues, sales feedback.
- Convert into tasks using the Intake Template (below).
- Tag each task by business line + type (growth, ops, content, R&D).

**Wed — Execute (30–40 min)**
- Pick top 1–3 tasks using scoring rubric (Impact × Effort).
- Complete or push to “needs input”.
- Ship outputs to `pm/outputs/` with date stamp.

**Fri — Review + Report (20 min)**
- Log what shipped, blockers, next week focus.
- Update PM status (done/blocked/in-progress).
- Share a 5‑bullet weekly snapshot.

```

Desired outcome:
Success criteria:

## Scoring Rubric (simple)
- **Impact**: 1 (low) → 5 (high)
- **Effort**: 1 (low) → 5 (high)
- **Priority score** = Impact / Effort

**Rule:** Do only items with score ≥ 2 unless strategic/urgent.
