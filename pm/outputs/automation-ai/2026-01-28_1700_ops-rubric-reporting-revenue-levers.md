## 1) Simple Task Scoring Rubric (Impact / Effort)
**Scale (1–5):**
- **Impact**: 1 = tiny improvement, 3 = meaningful lift, 5 = major revenue/retention/automation lift.
- **Effort**: 1 = <2 hours, 3 = 1–3 days, 5 = 2+ weeks.

**Quick Score**: `Priority = Impact / Effort`
- **Green**: 1.5+ (do next)
- **Yellow**: 0.8–1.49 (schedule)
- **Red**: <0.8 (defer)

**Tie‑breakers (if scores equal):**
1) Cash sooner (time‑to‑value)
2) Removes bottleneck / unblocks other work
3) Reusable system vs one‑off

**Example:**
- Task: “Add instant booking CTA” → Impact 4, Effort 2 → Score 2.0 (Green)
