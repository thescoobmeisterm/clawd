# Automation & Agent Systems — Scope + Weekly Workflow + Intake Template (v1)

## 1) 1‑Page Scope (T-0201)
**Goal:** Build a lightweight, repeatable ops system that reliably turns ideas → prioritized tasks → executed outcomes, with weekly visibility for Matt.

**In scope (Phase 1 — next 4–6 weeks):**
- **Intake → Triage → Execute → Review** loop for all tasks
- **Prioritization rubric** (Impact/Effort + urgency) and weekly selection of Top 3
- **Single source of truth** in pm-app (seed.json + outputs)
- **Weekly snapshot report** (what shipped, what’s next, blockers)
- **Baseline automations**: recurring checks, reminders, and simple data pulls

**Out of scope (Phase 1):**
- Full enterprise PM platform migration
- Complex integrations with paid SaaS without ROI proof
- Building custom UI beyond pm-app basics
- Heavy ML/AI workflows beyond task assistance

**Success Criteria:**
- 3+ meaningful tasks completed per week
- Weekly snapshot delivered consistently
- Clear, searchable output artifacts (pm/outputs)
- Reduced ambiguity: each task has owner, next action, and done criteria

**Primary Inputs:**
- Matt’s priorities, business goals, and deadlines
- Seed.json tasks + notes
- Quick feedback loop on what’s “high impact”

**Primary Outputs:**
- Completed tasks with artifacts
- Weekly snapshot report
- Updated task statuses with notes

## 2) Weekly Workflow (T-0202)
**Capture (Daily, 5–10 min):**
- Add new ideas/tasks to pm-app seed.json or notes
- Tag with business + owner + rough impact

**Triage (2x/week, 15–20 min):**
- Clarify: goal, deliverable, definition of done
- Score quick Impact/Effort
- Mark blockers + dependencies

**Execute (Mon–Fri, 60–120 min blocks):**
- Pull Top 3 tasks for week
- Produce tangible outputs in pm/outputs
- Update task status to done w/ notes + link

**Review (Weekly, 10–15 min):**
- Snapshot: shipped / in-progress / blocked
- Adjust backlog priorities
- Decide next Top 3
