## 1) Trust + Conversion Gaps (Quick Audit)

### A. Above-the-Fold (homepage)
- **Clear value prop in 1 sentence** (who it’s for + outcome).
- **Primary CTA** (Start/Book/Reserve) is visible without scrolling.
- **Secondary CTA** (Learn More/How it Works) for low-intent visitors.
- **Trust badge strip**: “Verified Owners | Insured Rides | 24/7 Support”.
- **Social proof snippet**: 1–2 review quotes or rating avg.

### B. Proof & Risk Reduction
- **Reviews/testimonials** with real names + locations.
- **Vehicle photos**: clean, consistent, in-use images (not stock).
- **Insurance/coverage details** in a plain-English summary.
- **Safety checks**: show verification, screening, and checklists.
- **FAQ** addressing top risks: damage, late returns, cancellations.

### C. Pricing & Transparency
- **Pricing clarity**: daily/weekly rates + fees visible up-front.
- **Total cost estimator**: shows add-ons/fees before checkout.
- **Refund/cancellation policy** in simple language.

### D. Conversion Flow
- **Checkout steps are clear** (1–3 steps ideally).
- **Account creation** after key intent (not first step).
- **Form friction**: reduce fields; add progress indicators.
- **Mobile-first**: CTA sticky bottom on mobile.

### E. Local Trust Signals
- **Local area credibility**: “Serving [City/Region] since [Year]”.
- **Partner logos** (if any) or affiliations.
- **Photos of real team/owners** if brand is personal.

### F. Performance
- **Load time**: under 3 seconds on mobile.
- **No broken links** or missing images.

**Quick Win Priorities (Top 5)**
1. Add a trust badge strip + insurance summary near CTA.
2. Add 2–3 testimonials with names + locations.
3. Make pricing/fees transparent before checkout.
4. Improve CTA hierarchy above-the-fold.
5. Add FAQ that addresses risk (damage, late, insurance).
