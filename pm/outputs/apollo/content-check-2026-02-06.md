## Suggested Content Ideas (Best Practices for Children's Educational Content)

Based on high-performing patterns in the 4-8 educational space:

### 1. **"Apollo's Shape Safari" Series**
- Short videos (3-5 min) featuring Apollo the alien finding shapes in everyday objects
- Interactive element: "Can you find the [shape] before Apollo?"
- High rewatch value for parents

### 2. **"Space Math Adventures"**
- Count-along stories with space themes
- Simple addition/subtraction using visual props
- Could tie into merchandise (rocket ships, planet visuals)

### 3. **"Feelings Friends" SEL Shorts**
- 1-2 min videos teaching emotional recognition
- Character-based: "Happy Hippo," "Sad Seahorse"
- Perfect for classroom/parent use
