# Nightly Build Report — Feb 15, 2026

**Runtime:** 11:00 PM - 11:30 PM  
**Focus:** Automation & Workflow Improvements

---

## Completed

### 1. Trend-to-Content POC Script
**File:** `pm/outputs/nightly-builds/2026-02-15_trend-to-content-poc.py`

Simple Python script that:
- Fetches trends (placeholder for Exa/Brave integration)
- Uses LLM (OpenRouter) to generate content concepts
- Outputs to markdown in pm/outputs/

**Next:** Integrate real search API, add cron scheduling

---

## PM Status

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| MOON-001 | in-progress | Autonomous Trend-to-Content Agent |
| MOON-002 | todo | Apollo video (depends on MOON-003) |
| MOON-003 | todo | Apollo growth strategy (Borg) |

---

## Observations

- All Clawd-assigned tasks in seed.json are DONE
- Borg should drive MOON-003 (Apollo strategy) before MOON-002 execution
- Nightly builds are creating useful tools but need Borg prioritization
