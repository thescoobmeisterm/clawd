# Task Proposals - 2026-02-02

Generated during scouting session - no Clawd tasks available.

## Context
Active projects: P-004 Apollo (Children's Media), P-002 Daydream Tees (Merch), P-001 Pluto LLC (Car-sharing)

## PROPOSAL 1: Apollo YouTube Shorts Factory System

**Project:** P-004 Apollo's Learning Corner  
**Type:** Automation / Content Ops  
**Priority:** HIGH

### Problem
Current content production requires manual scripting, storyboarding, and production for each video. This limits output to 1-2 videos/week and creates bottlenecks.

### Solution
Build a "Shorts Factory" system that:
- Converts existing book pages → auto-generated visuals using AI
- Uses consistent character templates (Apollo mascot)
- Batches 10+ shorts in a single production session
- Includes pre-approved template scripts for common themes (counting, colors, shapes, feelings)

### Impact
- **Speed:** Reduce production time from 4 hours/short to 30 minutes/short
- **Output:** Scale from 2 shorts/week to 10+ shorts/week
- **Revenue:** More content = more views = more subscribers = monetization path

### Deliverable
- Production playbook with templates
- Batch processing script
- 10 ready-to-film shorts

### Effort
Medium (4-6 hours to build, then reusable)

## PROPOSAL 2: Daydream Tees Multi-Platform Listing Engine

**Project:** P-002 Daydream Tees / Merch Ops  
**Type:** Automation / E-commerce Ops  
**Priority:** HIGH

### Problem
Manual listing on Etsy, eBay, and Printify takes 30+ minutes per design per platform. With 10+ designs, this becomes unsustainable and delays time-to-market.

### Solution
Create an automated listing engine that:
- Takes design files + metadata (title, tags, description)
- Auto-generates optimized listings for each platform
- Handles platform-specific requirements (Etsy tags, eBay categories, Printify variants)
- Includes bulk upload capability

### Impact
- **Speed:** Reduce listing time from 30 min/design to 2 min/design
- **Scale:** Enable 10+ designs/week instead of 2-3
- **Revenue:** Faster listing = more sales windows (especially around trends)

### Deliverable
- Automated listing generator (Node.js script)
- Platform-specific templates
- Batch upload workflow

### Effort
Medium (6-8 hours to build, high ROI)

## PROPOSAL 3: Pluto LLC Trust & Conversion Dashboard

**Project:** P-001 Pluto LLC / Car-Sharing Platform  
**Type:** Conversion Optimization  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

### Problem
Site audit identified trust + conversion gaps, but no system exists to track, test, and measure improvements.

### Solution
Build a "Trust Signals Dashboard" that:
- Tracks key metrics: booking abandonment rate, trust badge clicks, form completion
- A/B tests trust elements (badges, testimonials, guarantees)
- Provides real-time conversion insights
- Flags friction points in the booking flow

### Impact
- **Revenue:** Identify $100s-1000s in lost revenue from abandonment
- **Customer Appeal:** Systematic approach to building trust
- **Speed:** Faster iterations vs. guessing

### Deliverable
- Metrics dashboard prototype
- A/B test framework for trust elements
- Top 5 conversion fixes with priority scores

### Effort
Small-Medium (3-4 hours for MVP, iterative)

## Recommendation

**Pick PROPOSAL 2 (Daydream Tees Multi-Platform Engine)** for highest immediate ROI:
- Solves a clear bottleneck (manual listing)
- High time-to-market impact (10x faster)
- Enables scaling to 10+ designs/week
- Complements existing trend pipeline work

**Secondary pick:** PROPOSAL 1 (Apollo Shorts Factory) - aligns with YouTube growth strategy.
