## ⚡ Action Items Requiring Matt's Attention

**🔴 Decision Needed Today:**
1. **Monetization focus** — Which revenue model for Pluto? (membership, transaction, subscription, hybrid?)
2. **Storefront platform** — Where does Daydream Tees live? (Etsy first? Shopify?)
3. **MVP distribution** — How does Apollo's Learning Corner reach customers? (Etsy, YouTube, Amazon KDP?)

## 💡 Productivity Tip for the Afternoon

**Batch your decisions, not your work.**

You've got 3 linked decisions that affect each other (monetization → platform → distribution). Knock them out in one 15-minute session rather than spacing them out. Your brain will thank you for the clear context switching.
