# AI/Tool Research - February 4, 2026

## Executive Summary

Key findings from today's research on AI, autonomous agents, and productivity tools relevant to Matt's business portfolio.

---

## 1. Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems

### Trend: Agentic AI (Autonomous Workflows)

**What it is:** Agentic AI refers to systems that don't just generate answers but plan and execute multi-step tasks autonomously. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 80% of customer-facing processes will be handled by multi-agent AI.

**Relevance to Matt's projects:**
- **Apollo's Learning Corner:** Could automate content pipelines (script → video → blog → social)
- **Daydream Tees:** Automate trend research → design generation → listing creation
- **Pluto LLC:** Automate customer onboarding, support workflows, compliance checks

**Effort:** Medium (requires workflow design upfront)
**Priority:** HIGH - Foundation for next-gen automation
